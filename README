Sample Android app that delegates the OAuth Dance to an external server.
That way, the Android app does not need to store the consumer secret in code.
The OAuth dance consisting of 

* fetching request token
* authorizing request token
* upgrading the access token

is all done on a external server.

Accompanying article will be posted at http://blog.doityourselfandroid.com

Goes through all the steps of the OAuth Flow

* Get Request Token
* Authorize Token
* Get Access Token
* Perform Google API call (retrieve current location).

In the Constants class, replace 

	public static final String CONSUMER_KEY = "anonymous";
	
with your Google registered domain.
